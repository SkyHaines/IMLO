Submission form answer prep:

Achieved classification accuracy of the final trained model on both the official CIFAR-10
training data set and the official CIFAR-10 test data set respectively.

• the neural network architecture you designed

I assume this is what is in the class NeuralNetwork() function defined, so perhaps it'll ask me about the layer stacks? so like 

(0) in_features = x out_features = y
(1) ReLU()
(2) ….


• the training process you have followed

Im not sure what this wants, perhaps a description of how I adjusted the learning/step rate and number of epochs to improve accuracy without increasing time above the limit? 

• the loss functions you have used

This will probably be the cross entropy loss, so read up on how it works? **
Maybe also the place to mention the optimiser?

• the final trained model

??
